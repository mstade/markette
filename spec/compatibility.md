Compatibility
============

One of the goals of PHML is to obsolete [Markdown], by providing backwards compatibility with [Markdown] wherever possible. There exists some situations however, where ambiguities or flaws of [Markdown] cause problems. In this case, PHML draws a line in the sand, adhering to the [principle of least surprise][POLS]. This means issues are resolved in an unambiguous and intuitive manner.

This section is dedicated to documenting these issues and how PHML resolves them.

### Newlines

[Markdown] declares that in order to force a line break, a line must end with two or more [whitespace characters] and a single line feed (U+000a). This means that any line that just ends with a single line feed (U+000a) should not be considered a hard line break. This is unintuitive since in the original plain text source is in fact a hard line break, but a parser should ignore it.

For example, the following text in [Markdown] should be considered a single run of text with no line breaks:

```
Roses are red,   
Violets are blue.
```

In PHML, the line break is recognized as intentional and tooling must respect it.

### Emphasis

[Markdown] defines emphasis as text surrounded by asterisks (U+002a) or underscores (U+005f). In the following example, the word `during` is emphasized using asterisks and underscores:

```
They were talking *during* the movie.
They were talking _during_ the movie.
```

[Markdown] also supports strong emphasis by using double asterisks or double underscores:

```
It is **very important** to not talk during the movie.
It is __very important__ to not talk during the movie.
```

Additionally, [Markdown] supports intra-word emphasis; i.e. emphasis in the middle of a word. The following is an example of this:

```
They were talking during the movie? Un*frigging* believable.
They were talking during the movie? Un_frigging_ believable.
```

There may well exist reasons why one would like to put emphasis in the middle of a word â€“ dramatic effect in prose, for instance. However, it doesn't read well and it introduces ambiguities when dealing with text that makes legitimate use of these characters. Therefore, PHML does *not* support intra-word emphasis.

### Verbatim Text

[Markdown] has syntax for pre-formatted code blocks, which is indented by four spaces or one tab character. It also has support for pre-formatted code inline, which is defined as text wrapped by backtick (U+0060) characters.
