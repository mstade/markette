Common Infrastructure
=====================

Markette as a specification relies upon other technologies. This section discussed them, in no particular order.

Unicode
-------

At the very heart of Markette is the [Unicode] standard â€“ it defines a universal character encoding standard for written characters and text. Of particular importance to Markette is UTF-8, a variable-width encoding that can represent every character in the Unicode character set.

UTF-8 is the default encoding for Markette; this means that unless otherwise specified, tooling should assume UTF-8 when reading documents. Please refer to the [Encoding Standard] for more information on encoding and decoding byte streams.

### Newlines

There are two kinds of line breaks: hard and soft. Hard line breaks define a position in the text where one line ends and the next one starts, unequivocally. Soft line breaks also define a position in the text where one line ends and the next one starts, but such a break may be ignored when certain circumstances apply.

Markette does not recognize any soft break characters in its syntax, and only specifies behavior for [hard break characters]. It is recommended that processors consider the [Unicode line breaking algorithm][UAX14] when processing soft break characters.

URL
---

Markette is designed to be a full featured hypermedia format. A key technology to support this is [URL], which is used to identify and locate resources.

URI Templates
-------------

In addition to [URL] technology, Markette supports the use of [URI templates] in some hypermedia controls. [URI templates] are a way to compactly describe a range of URLs, and can be used to implement some forms.

Markdown
--------

Because [Markdown] is essentially a subset of Markette, *almost* any content written in [Markdown] is compatible with Markette without modification. However, there exist some cases where [Markdown] content may not align fully with the Markette specification. This is more fully explored in the [compatibility] section of this specification.
