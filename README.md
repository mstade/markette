This specification is a [living standard], meaning it's versionless and continually evolves. There may or may not come a point where this specification is considered "complete", such that there is no way it can meaningfully evolve anymore. Whether or not this is true is very difficult to predict, so "completion" is not a specific goal.

Versionless means that the spec itself does not refer to any snapshots of itself. A client of this spec may refer to a specific version however, meaning it may refer to the way it looked at a specific point in time. It must do so explicitly however, and otherwise it must be assumed that the client just refers to the latest iteration. This means that great care must be taken when updating the spec, so that it doesn't break backwards compatibility, and that there only ever exists one canonical representation of the spec. Other representations may exist, such as forks and work-in-progress updates, but they should be considered derivative works that may or may not be merged at some point in time.
